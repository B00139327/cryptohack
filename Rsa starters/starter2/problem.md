RSA encryption is modular exponentiation of a message with an exponent e and a modulus N which is normally a product of two primes: N = p * q.

Together the exponent and modulus form an RSA "public key" (N, e). The most common value for e is 0x10001 or 65537.

"Encrypt" the number 12 using the exponent e = 65537 and the primes p = 17 and q = 23. What number do you get as the ciphertext?
