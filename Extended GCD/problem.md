Let a and b be positive integers.

The extended Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way to find integers u,v such that

a * u + b * v = gcd(a,b)

 Later, when we learn to decrypt RSA, we will need this algorithm to calculate the modular inverse of the public exponent.


Using the two primes p = 26513, q = 32321, find the integers u,v such that

p * u + q * v = gcd(p,q)

 Knowing that p,q are prime, what would you expect gcd(p,q) to be?
